# Optimizer Benchmark Method

## Decision

The benchmark exists to falsify or support one economic claim. It is not a
general Citadel showcase.

The funded target is at least 30% lower total operation cost while retaining at
least 95% of always-frontier verified completions. The smaller pre-application
gate is:

- at least 20% lower held-out median cost than always-frontier;
- no loss of held-out verified completions in the frozen preliminary set;
- adaptive beats prompt-only on verified completion, or ties it at lower
  effective cost per verified completion;
- unknown cost cannot contribute to savings;
- zero false passes across tamper, incomplete, model-substitution, and crash
  cases.

The commits were confirmed from the public repositories on 2026-07-29.

## Symmetry and anti-gaming

Every policy receives the same repository commit, task, setup, verifier,
allowed tools, timeout, attempts, agent limit, and candidate executor set.
Policy, scenario, and repetition form a unique matrix key. Missing, duplicate,
or caller-injected runs fail report construction.

The policy cannot read fixture truth. `learnCapabilityProfiles()` rejects any
holdout record. A precommitted future public-randomness beacon selects one
already frozen holdout without human discretion.
The local matrix signer is separate from the public drand selector. The proof
bundle is rebuilt on a clean hosted runner.

The runner verifies repository tests and requires every expected artifact to
appear in the Git diff. Each verification attempt preserves a bounded,
path- and secret-redacted verifier-output excerpt, patch excerpt, digests, changed paths,
exit status, and truncation flags before deleting its temporary workspace.
A successful task counts only when:

- repository verification passes;
- the outcome is marked verified;
- observed-model proof passes;
- the execution receipt is verified.

An optional third-party rerun may use a separate record and public key. Citadel
checks that the signed actual run matches the public-random selected scenario
and that its digest matches the freeze. This optional path is not required for
the submission gate.

## Probe boundary

Adaptive routing may perform bounded read-only reconnaissance:

- real directories only;
- no symlink traversal;
- fixed file, byte, and duration ceilings;
- package manifests, test commands, language mix, CI/test presence, and
  task-relevant file names;
- no model call during the probe.

The prompt-only baseline receives task text but no repository probe.

## Cost accounting

Each attempt reports a strict cost object. Multi-attempt adaptive work sums
every known component. If any attempt cost is unknown, the total is unknown.
Failed attempts are still included.

The report exposes both total known cost and whether all cost is known, but
economic comparisons use authoritative total and median cost only when the
relevant runs are fully known.

Fixture pricing multipliers are deterministic report-test inputs. They are
plainly labeled non-claim assumptions and are not vendor prices.

The actual-run Codex snapshot is separately frozen from those fixtures. It
uses the official API list price observed on 2026-07-29, including cached-input
rates and the documented multiplier above 272K input tokens. Its
`billing_basis` is `official_api_list_price`: a normalized resource-cost basis,
not a representation of subscription billing. Claude uses the runtime's
vendor-reported `total_cost_usd`.

## Evidence ladder

1. **Contract proof**: local unit tests, deterministic policies, frozen
   identities, anti-tamper tests.
2. **Calibration**: 4 completed, non-holdout CLI runs (one scenario × 4 frozen
   profiles) prove account access, observed model identity, and known cost
   sources. The digest-bound record reports 0/4 task-verifier passes, so it is
   not performance evidence. A no-model forensic reproduction found that the
   original full-repository verifier failed on unrelated lint and TypeScript
   tooling before reaching the task tests. The old scenario set is archived
   unchanged with that record. The actual matrix is re-frozen with a
   task-focused verifier that fails on the queue bug and passes a bounded
   repair touching both expected artifacts. The subscription-quota budget
   capped calibration at 4 runs and 160 aggregate model-runtime timeout
   minutes.
3. **Diagnostic pilot**: a separately authorized, non-claim two-run check
   completed with one frontier profile from each runtime, capped at 2 CLI runs
   and 80 aggregate model-runtime timeout minutes. Both identity and receipt
   gates passed. Claude changed `index.js` and passed all 22 task tests but the
   immutable record remained failed because the scenario also required an
   unnecessary `test.js` edit. Codex made no patch and failed the verifier. A
   zero-call forensic replay classifies the Claude result as an artifact-gate
   false negative; the future matrix copy is re-frozen with only `index.js`
   required. This is harness evidence, not comparative performance evidence.
4. **Public-random selection**: a future drand round committed while the method
   is public selects one already frozen holdout before the local matrix starts.
5. **Preliminary evidence**: complete frozen actual-run matrix and held-out
   gate.
6. **Clean verification**: public selection record, approved matrix
   authorization, signed privacy-safe raw records, and one-command rebuild on a
   clean hosted runner.
7. **Grant claim**: only the claims supported by steps 5 and 6.

There is no calendar promise. Progress advances when an evidence gate closes.

Actual matrix execution remains fail-closed until the public-random scenario is
selected and the user explicitly approves consuming the frozen run, model-call,
and runtime allowance from their subscription quota. Both gates are now closed:
the holdout is selected and Seth Gammon approved the exact subscription
envelope at `2026-07-30T20:44:02.628Z`. A third-party model rerun is optional
and is not a submission blocker.

The approved authorization caps the matrix at 120 CLI cells, 162 model attempts,
and 7,230 aggregate timeout-minutes. The timeout figure is the sum of every
per-attempt fail-safe timeout; it is not expected elapsed time, usage-based
billing, or a claim about subscription cost.

The resumable matrix driver writes a durable intent before each cell, validates
the signed output before marking it complete, skips verified completed cells,
and halts on an ambiguous cell instead of silently retrying quota after a crash.

The no-model selection tooling emits a digest-bound request, commits to a
future drand round, requires three identical relay responses, derives exactly
one frozen holdout, and writes a reviewable candidate freeze. Optional
third-party-rerun tooling reports its exact call/runtime envelope before
execution, requires a distinct signing key and explicit quota acknowledgement,
and validates the signed record before writing a second candidate freeze. No
one is asked to perform that optional rerun. The selection method was public
before the committed round.
Round `6333716` selected `citadel-short-executor-proof`; three relays agreed,
the BLS signature verified, and the selection record is frozen.

The proof bundle carries three scenario sets:
`inputs/calibration-scenarios/` reproduces the exact set used by calibration,
`inputs/diagnostic-pilot-scenarios/` preserves the exact pilot inputs, and
`inputs/scenarios/` is the corrected set frozen for the actual matrix. It
verifies the calibration record and forensics, the immutable pilot record and
forensic replay, and every scenario-set identity.
